# Machine-Learning-Build-XGB-model-and-Random-Forest-model-To-Identidy-Fake-Job-Postings-
I work for an online job posting service like Indeed, Monster or LinkedIn and the service has been hit with a number of fake job postings. 
There are a number of reasons why fake job postings exist. Scammers post fake jobs to commit some form of identity theft. 
Companies have a number of reasons to post fake positions one is to gauge the current talent pool another is to build up a list of potential candidates for another position. 
It’s annoying and since we are deep diving into machine learning we aren’t going to take it. The firm believes that the presence of a logo, 
a salary range and if they have questions is an indicator of a legit job posting. 
My job is to identify fake job postings using XGB model and Random Forest Model to identify the fake job postings.
